SiMS2 is a 2D mechanics simulation library written in Scala.


It is a complete re-write of SiMS, hosted at http://sourceforge.net/projects/simplemechanics/.

=Features=
  * 2D rigid body simulation
  * standalone collision detection (can be used without SiMS2 physics library)
  * constraint simulation
  * extensible architecture

----

SiMS2 is currently in development and no stable release is available.
However, there exists a graphical testbed using the Processing.org library. To run it: 
  # Checkout the latest project revision.
  # If you don't already have it, install sbt (http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/).
  # In the sbt command prompt, run the command "demo".
  # Navigation in the graphical demo: 
    * pause/unpause: 'space'
    * single step: 'enter'
    * previous/next test: '<'/'>'
    * zoom in/out: 'page up'/'page down';
    * move: arrow keys;
