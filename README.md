# SiMS2 #
SiMS2 is a 2D mechanics simulation library written in Scala.

It is a complete re-write of SiMS, hosted at http://sourceforge.net/projects/simplemechanics/.

# Features #
  * 2D rigid body simulation
  * standalone collision detection (can be used without SiMS2 physics library)
  * constraint simulation
  * extensible architecture

---

SiMS2 is currently in development and no stable release is available.
However, there exists a graphical testbed using the Processing.org library. To run it: 
 1. Checkout the latest project revision.
 2. If you don't already have it, install sbt (http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/).
 3. In the sbt command prompt, run the command "demo".
 4. Navigation in the graphical demo: 
     * pause/unpause: `space`
     * single step: `enter`
     * previous/next test: `<`/`>`
     * zoom in/out: `page up`/`page down`;
     * move: `arrow keys`;
